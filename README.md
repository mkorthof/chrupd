\* _Defaults in **bold**_

Make sure the combination of name and channel you pick is correct. You can also use `chrupd.cmd -list`. For more information about versions check [chromium.woolyss.com](https://chromium.woolyss.com/?cut=1&ago=1), it's [feed](https://chromium.woolyss.com/feed/windows-64-bit) and [chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org).

Notes:

- using `-name Ungoogled` also works (alias for Ungoogled-Marmaduke)
- for the builds from chromium.org use `Official`
- some authors release archive files instead of installers, for more info see [docs/Files.md](/docs/Files.md#archives)

## ‚è∞ Scheduled Task

To make sure Chromium is always automatically updated to the latest version you can optionally add a Scheduled Task by using `chrupd.cmd -crTask`. A VBS wrapper will be written to **chrupd.vbs** which is used to hide it's window. Option `-noVbs` disables the wrapper, this will however cause a flashing window when the task runs. Specifed settings for 'name' and 'channel' are used to run the script every day.

## üîÉ Updating Script

The script auto updates itself (since v20210109).

(**!**) If you keep getting an error about "Unable to get new script, skipped update", this means a new version was detected but the script was unable to get the new version from GitHub. Try again later or manually update.

To manually update to a newer script version just replace "chrupd.cmd". Copy "name" and "channel" if set. If you a have Scheduled Task setup, you do not need to change the task.

## üìÅ Files

File 'chrupd.cmd' is all you need to run.

Options can be set in script or by using command line arguments.

See [docs/Files.md](/docs/Files.md) for details about all repository files.

## üíª Command Line Options
